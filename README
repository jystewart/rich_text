RichText
========

Rails engine to get you up and running with the tinymce rich text editor 
and some utilities to pull in video and images.

This is a quick hack to get a couple of our projects up and running. We wouldn't
necessarily recommend it to anyone else.

We depend on jquery and use tiny_mce and thickbox to make this all work.

Install the engine and then:

  script/generate rich_text

Then in your views you need to add:

<%= rich_text_tags(css_selector) %>
